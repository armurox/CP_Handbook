# The Competitive Programmer's Handbook
The Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen is a fantastic resource. This repo records some of the code I'm writing while going through the book. They will include snippets from the book, along with some mixes and matches as I play around and extend some of the ideas. This repo also includes a directory with my implementations of some algorithms and data structures.
